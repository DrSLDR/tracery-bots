# Tracery Bots

_Tracery configurations for (Dr)SLDR's Twitter and Mastodon bots_

This repository contains the JSON files that define the [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammars for my bots. Twitter bots are run on [Cheap Bots, Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) and the Mastodon bots are... not run anywhere - the framework I wanted to use seems to have gone away.

## ProofByBot

[@ProofByBot](https://twitter.com/ProofByBot) on Twitter, not yet on Mastodon

A humorous take on dense academic papers, employing Proof by Intimidation. Generating real-sounding but probably fake citations, lemmas, theses, and whatnot.

Name list needs some expansion, and perhaps some more variety of fancy words.

## AutoTarot

Not yet on any network. Still figuring this one out.

Need your fortune told? Need some life advice? AutoTarot can help, by drawing cards that are almost certainly _not_ in any ordinary tarot deck.

## Usage

These files should plug straight into Tracery. Feel free to use these files as you wish, or suggest additions to me. I'd ask you to not use these files as they are, creating identical bots, but hey, I can't stop you ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
